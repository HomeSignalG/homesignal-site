# QUEUE

In-flight work for the Maps / ingest go-live run. **Claude Code owns this file** — updated in
the same PR as the work, or as a standalone commit when nothing else changes. It must never
drift from reality.

Format per workbook `0070Maps IngestFeedInventory.xlsx` Instructions row 348. Seeded from
row 376 (the corrected queue) — **not** row 364, which is superseded.

**Division of record (row 396):** QUEUE.md holds in-flight work — items, states, gates,
dependencies. The workbook holds settled outcomes, rules, worked examples, and measured
per-ZIP/per-source state. Do not mirror queue items into the workbook; two queues drift.

## Rules of use (row 349)

- **Re-read this file before starting anything.**
- **If a founder instruction conflicts with it, SAY SO AND ASK** — never silently follow the
  newer one. When handed a sequence, reconcile it against this file and report any conflict
  **before** acting.
- Dependencies are explicit. An item can never be ordered before something it modifies.
- **Rule 16:** scope is fixed at authorization. New findings become new items here, not
  extensions of work in progress — this binds the founder as much as the agent.

## Standing frame

- **Goal (row 380):** 12,722 ZIP pages, 50 states. Live: NV 158 + TX 668 + UT 310 = **1,136**.
  **8,215 remain** — 5,647 across 34 partial states, 2,568 across 13 untouched.
- **LIVE is not COVERED (row 381).** Texas is the standing example. ⚠️ **The "zero
  `government_notice` sources" half is FALSE as measured 2026-07-30** — see TX-GOV below.
  The principle stands; the number does not. Always report both numbers.
- **7-phase playbook (rows 383–389).** Phases 1–6 are the work and are autonomous.
  **Phase 7 is the gate: the CLAIM** — sitemap, coverage claim, or reporting a state live.
  One report per state at Phase 7, not per phase.
- **Check the known blockers (row 391) before debugging any environment problem.**

## RESUME POINT — read this first (updated 2026-07-31, DE complete)

The loop: run the scoreboard -> state nearest 90% on RECORD coverage -> uncovered counties
largest-first -> search-first discovery -> three-part liveness test -> wire on an existing
connector family -> PR/merge/deploy/verify -> one-line report when a state crosses 90%.

### Done

- **SCOREBOARD FIXED (row 429)** — PR #442. Ranks on RECORDS LANDING, not the coverage gate;
  emits both plus `gate_overstatement`. RPC `dev_zip_source_ids` (parked at
  `docs/dev-zip-source-ids-rpc.sql`), `continue-on-error` removed, runner asserts its own row
  count. Control: NV reproduces 139/158 exactly.
- **NV — UNREACHABLE** per rows 427/428. Do not reopen without a statewide federal-land source.
- ✅ **DE — 46/68 (67.6%) -> 68/68 (100%).** Sussex was the only dark county; all 22 ZIP pages now
  carry records. Wired `sussex-county-de-conditional-use` (PRs #444 · #445 docs · #446 pin fix).
  468 records, 0 missing `record_url`, 0 unclassified, 0 missing coordinates. Bidirectional gate
  proof: 0 Sussex records on Kent or New Castle pages.

### Three findings from the DE build worth carrying

1. **A clean closed vocabulary can be the WRONG column, and that is more dangerous than a missing
   one — it looks complete.** Sussex `current_zoning` is a tidy 38-value set summing exactly to
   2,566. It was rejected as the type source because a conditional use is BY DEFINITION something
   the existing zoning does not allow: `AR-1 -> Residential` would have labelled an
   electrical-substation application "Residential" on 1,987 of 2,566 rows. Zoning describes the
   PARCEL; `use_type` must describe the PROPOSAL.
2. **`use_type_const` was a live false-Live trap and is now real.** The scoreboard already accepted
   it as satisfying the pin-icon requirement while NO connector implemented it and NO entry used
   it. The first entry to set it would have been counted toward Live while pages rendered
   unclassified pins, with nothing failing. Now implemented in `sources/arcgis.ts` (mirrors
   `status_const`); setting both it and a `type_map` is a quarantined config error.
3. **Omitting `column_map.lat/lng` fails SILENTLY.** All 468 Sussex records first cached at
   `scope:"area"` on the ZIP centroid instead of their parcels. `returnGeometry=true` is always
   sent and `featurePoint()` resolves fine — the coordinates are just never read, so the records
   publish, carry `record_url`, pass the anti-fabrication gate and count toward coverage. Caught
   only by checking `scope` on live rows. A registry-wide assertion now pins it (0 violations
   across 102 arcgis entries).

### Next — CO, and it looks HARD; measure before committing

Record coverage, measured 2026-07-31: **CO 83/140 = 59.3%, 57 dark, needs +43.**

| county | ZIP pages | dark |
|---|---|---|
| Douglas | 14 | 14 |
| Weld | 12 | 12 |
| Jefferson | 10 | 10 |
| Larimer | 13 | 8 |
| Arapahoe | 11 | 5 |
| El Paso | 34 | 5 |
| Boulder | 8 | 2 |
| La Plata | 1 | 1 |

⚠️ **CO needs essentially EVERY remaining county** (14+12+10+8 = 44, barely over the 43 needed), and
CLAUDE.md already records rejections for most of them: **Douglas = aggregate-by-design** (row 424,
684 rows of Geography x Year x Quarter, `geometryType: null`), Arapahoe/Larimer/Weld "no
first-party catalog", Adams/Jeffco "polygon district layers only" (that last one predates the
polygon geometry pass — **worth re-probing, the connector can pin polygons now**). Apply row 428
early: if the dark ZIPs cannot yield records, record CO UNREACHABLE and move on rather than
grinding.

After CO by record_pct: **NC 48.8% -> TN 44.2% -> VA 39.7% -> WA 37.6% -> MD 37.5% -> AZ 36.8% ->
UT 35.2%.**

Already measured, so the next session does not re-derive:
- **NC** dark: Mecklenburg 34 · Buncombe 20 · Chatham 12 · Orange 10 · Union 9 · Wake 2.
  Mecklenburg alone is a third of the gap and is Charlotte — a real open-data city.
- **TN** dark: Shelby 41 · Rutherford 15 · Montgomery 13 · Williamson 12 · Sumner 9 · Maury 8 ·
  Wilson 7 · Hamilton 5 · Davidson 1. Shelby = Memphis; note QUEUE item SHELBY-429 (opendatasoft
  connector) is a NEW CONNECTOR FAMILY and therefore gated.

### Standing notes

- **pg_net probes: send NO `User-Agent`** (a UA makes IIS hosts 400 — the failure is ours).
- **Always paginate `dev_zip_source_ids`.** One un-paginated call returned the first 5,000 ZIPs,
  NV's 89xxx sorted past the end, and NV read 0/158 — a wrong zero that looked like a finding.
- **Check `scope` on live rows after any wire**, not just the record count (finding 3 above).
- **Read `docs/source-registry.md` for the county BEFORE probing it** — Sussex already had a
  "STILL NOT WIREABLE" section for a DIFFERENT endpoint (`/trdserver/Permit_Points`, 827,020 rows,
  undecodable `a_status`). That record still stands; the reconciliation table is in the new
  "SUSSEX COUNTY DE — WIRED via CONDITIONAL USE" section.

## Ordered items

### 1. DB-01 — `public.communities` planner-statistics diagnosis
- **State:** **DONE** (2026-07-30) — recorded in workbook 0071 rows 399–401; row 397 marked
  SUPERSEDED.
- **Gate:** was NONE for investigation. No autovacuum or schema change was made.
- **Depends on:** —
- **SUPERSEDED: the hypothesis was FALSE on every count.** It claimed no planner statistics, so
  the planner assumed the table was empty and chose sequential scans over the GIN index.
  1. **The planner was never blind.** `pg_class.reltuples` = **13,212** (real 13,292, 0.6% off)
     and `pg_stats` carried all **10** columns including `zip_codes`. `n_live_tup` belongs to the
     cumulative stats collector — a different subsystem from the planner.
  2. **`n_live_tup = 0` was arithmetically correct.** `communities` has had **zero writes** in
     the stats window (`n_tup_ins/upd/del` all 0), so the derived live-tuple figure is 0 and
     `n_mod_since_analyze = 0`, which is why autovacuum correctly never fired — there was
     nothing to analyze. Positive controls on the same query: `alerts` 374 ins → 11,526 live;
     `app_projects` 930,086 ins → 2,641,302 live.
  3. **The GIN index was already serving the hot path** — `idx_scan` = **14,697**, and the live
     plan is `Bitmap Index Scan on idx_communities_zip_codes_gin`, 0.465 ms.
  4. **ANALYZE changed no plan.** `reltuples` 13,212 → 13,292, `n_live_tup` 0 → 13,292, plan
     identical, 0.465 → 0.453 ms (noise).
  5. **Scope error caught:** `pg_stat_statements` had been reset ~2.5 h earlier while the table
     counters cover a far longer window, so the 5,977 seq scans **cannot** be attributed from
     it. Stated rather than guessed.
- **Settled, unchanged:** regional read replicas are NOT the lever.
- **Spun out:** see DB-02 below.

### 1a. DB-02 — latent: `communities` slug lookup cannot use its index
- **State:** BLOCKED (no action needed today — recorded so it is not rediscovered as an
  emergency; workbook 0071 row 400)
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** the only slug index is `communities_slug_lower_key` on the **expression**
  `lower(slug)`, which a plain `slug = $1` predicate cannot use — hence `idx_scan = 0` on it and
  a 13,291-row `Seq Scan` (3.209 ms) when that predicate is issued. **Harmless today: no code
  path issues it** — `hs-resolve.js` uses `zip_codes=cs.{…}` (GIN) and `id=in.(…)` (PK).
- **Acceptance:** if anything ever queries by raw slug, either add a plain btree on `slug` or
  make the query use `lower(slug)`.

### 2. PR-428 — registry status/type maps + drift gate
- **State:** **DONE — MERGED** `484f277` (squash), 2026-07-30.
- **Verified green before merge, not assumed:** confirming run `30573378376` →
  `Registry entries checked: 105 · gating: 0 · unreachable: 3` ·
  `No in-window unmapped statuses anywhere in the registry. Nothing gates.` ·
  `[dry-run] done: 0 wired, 146 flagged, 196 findings, 0 status-drift.` The Tier 1 table is
  gone entirely. Step 8 (the gate) shows **skipped**, which is the designed path — the step is
  driven by the `STATUS_DRIFT=1` marker and the marker was never set. Checked the log rather
  than reading a skipped step as a pass. PR checks: `unit` ×2, `verify`, `monitor` all success.
- **Option 3 (merge with the gate red) was rejected by the founder** — it would have left
  `source-monitor` permanently red on `main`, the exact condition avoided by not hosting this
  check in `verify-development`.
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** —
- **Actual state (rows 370–375, verified from GitHub):** open, `mergeable_state: clean`,
  head `claude/loving-archimedes-gtqk76` @ `e0afcc6`, **4 commits**, 9 files, +907/−25,
  based on `c49c7c4`.
- ⚠️ **Group A and Group B are ALREADY COMMITTED. Do not re-scope them.** Group A:
  new-orleans +27 · new-hanover +6 · tacoma-accela +1 · gilbert-energov +1. Group B:
  `status_unresolved` for cincinnati 7 · new-orleans 2 · fort-collins 1 · san-jose 1.
- **Remaining, exactly three things:** (1) rebase onto `0d011e6` — **done**, 64/64 (not the
  recorded 67/67; see the reconciliation log);
  (2) **San Diego `workflow_dispatch`** — the last unaudited entry; (3) merge when the drift
  check would run green.
- **Acceptance:** rebased · San Diego observed · drift check green · merged. **No 105/105
  claim until San Diego is observed** (row 344 — do not round a partial up to a complete).

### 3. PR-431 — connector fixture suites into CI
- **State:** IN-PROGRESS — **rebased onto `0d011e6`**, suite **66/66 green**, CI running.
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** — (independent of #428; both branched from `c49c7c4`)
- **Detail:** head `claude/fixture-suites-into-ci` @ `44df2e0`, 1 commit, 8 files, +60/−31.
  Moves 4 never-referenced `scripts/*.fixture-test.ts` suites under `test/` so the runner
  discovers them. Row 342: these produced **no signal**, never a false green. Row 351: it is
  **four** renames, not five — `tdlr-tabs` imports a nonexistent module and cannot be moved.
- **Acceptance:** merged, `unit` green at 66 files.

### 4. TX-GOV — Texas `government_notice` — **CLOSED / PARKED**
- **State:** **DONE (closed 2026-07-30)** — Phase 2 discovery complete across all 19 uncovered
  counties. **Closed at 7 of 610 pages reachable.**
- **Gate:** founder decision taken — **park after the cheap wins.**
- **The reason: vendor fragmentation.** 19 counties span **at least 8 distinct systems**, and
  **69% of the gap** — Dallas 174 + El Paso 145 + Tarrant 99 = **418 pages** — needs bespoke work
  or a new connector family. There is no cheap majority. Tier 1 is 629 pages converting **six
  states** from partial to COMPLETE on connectors that already exist; TX is already 668/668 live,
  so the gov gap **deepens a live state** while Tier 1 **makes six more states exist.**
- ✅ **Shipped:** `gov-comal-tx-commission` — Comal County, 7 pages, Granicus
  `co-comal-tx.granicus.com/ViewPublisherRSS.php?view_id=1&mode=agendas`. Both halves wired
  (`public.feeds` sort_order 850 + `feeds.csv`). Verify on post-deploy rows after the 2-hourly
  ingest — **not cache.**

#### The inventory — attached so nobody re-derives it

| Verdict | Counties (pages) |
|---|---|
| **`first_party_found`, WIRED** | Comal 7 |
| **`verification_blocked`** — source exists, our probe refused | Dallas 174 (PDFs; WebFetch 403) · Tarrant 99 (live system `agendamgmtprod.tarrantcountytx.gov`) · Travis 86 (not re-probed search-first) · Bexar 2 (CivicPlus AgendaCenter; **400**) · Harris 1 (Legistar confirmed; **400** twice) |
| **Rejected on liveness** | Tarrant Granicus (archive + **Test View** only) · Hays 8 (100 items, newest **Nov 2019**) |
| **New connector family needed** | El Paso 145 **NovusAgenda** · Bastrop 5 **CivicWeb** · Burnet 4 **DestinyHosted** · Llano 3 **CIRA** |
| **Bespoke county systems** | Collin 28 (ColdFusion `eagenda`) · Montgomery 22 (static) · Fort Bend 21 (ColdFusion `agendalink`) |
| **Not probed** | Hudspeth · Caldwell · Lampasas · Liberty · Walker (1 each = 5) |

*(7 + 174 + 99 + 86 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 145 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 28 + 22 + 21 + 5 = 610 ✓)*

#### CIRA sweep — run, and it does NOT change the parking decision
`newtools.cira.state.tx.us` is a genuine Texas state-association host carrying many counties'
Commissioners Court notices on a uniform path (`/page/<county>.Commissioners.Court`,
`/page/<county>.Public.Notices`) — Cooke, Robertson, Comanche, Polk, Liberty, Presidio, Fannin,
Medina, Gaines, Llano surfaced in one search. **But it hosts the SMALL rural counties we do not
model.** Of our 19, only **Llano (3) and Liberty (1)** are CIRA-hosted — **4 pages**, not a
statewide long tail of modelled pages. Content is PDFs behind HTML listing pages, so it would
still need a new adapter. **Lever rejected.**

#### DEFERRED — scoped, parked, do not start
Tarrant `agendamgmtprod` characterisation (99) · NovusAgenda spike + modelled-county sweep
(145) · Collin / Montgomery / Fort Bend bespoke (71) · Dallas + Travis search-first re-probes
(260) · the 5 unprobed single-page counties.

### 5. EXP-HARRIS-BEXAR — Step B expansion
- **State:** BLOCKED
- **Gate:** **Founder decision — it moves the coverage claim.** Report, then hold.
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** Harris has 1 modeled ZIP, Bexar 2, leaving **4 correctly-wired entries emitting
  0 records**. Precedent: NYC-borough / Boston-Suffolk / Philadelphia-County.
- **Acceptance:** pages-added and per-entry record counts reported as page-level deltas
  (Rule 10). **Then stop** — no rows inserted, no coverage claim changed.

### 6. SD-AUDIT — San Diego `workflow_dispatch`
- **State:** **DONE — OBSERVED.** Run `30569691125` on the #428 ref, `dry_run=true`.
  Step 5 "Run source monitor" **succeeded** (9.5 min); step 8, the drift gate, failed **by
  design** (it is deliberately last so evidence lands first). Run summary, verbatim:
  `Registry entries checked: 105 · gating: 1 · unreachable: 3` ·
  `[dry-run] done: 0 wired, 147 flagged, 196 findings, 1 status-drift.`
  **105 CHECKED — 101 clean, 3 unreachable, 1 gating.** San Diego was the last unobserved
  entry, so the sweep is complete; but "105/105 clean" would be wrong — see SD-UNREACHABLE.
- **What it found — San Diego is the SOLE gating entry:**
  `| san-diego-approved-permits | APPROVAL_STATUS | no recency window — whole dataset is
  in-window | ``Pending Invoice Payment`` (11) |` — 11 records dropped today.
  Tier 2 (latent, non-gating): `new-orleans-permits` 6 out-of-window values. Tier 3: 6
  `denver-residential-construction-permits` case-only differences, all resolving via the
  case-folded lookup — **independent confirmation that Denver never drifted** (row 342).
  3 entries unreachable, reported as unreachable and never as drift, as designed.
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** PR-428 (the drift check it exercises lives on that branch)
- **Detail:** the last unaudited entry of the 105. It is the CSV-family reader
  (`san-diego-approved-permits`, a 15 MB published file), which is why it was never observed.
- **Acceptance:** run observed; only then may the entry set be described as complete.
  **No 105/105 claim until then.**

### 6a. GOV-PORT — port durable governance out of the workbook onto main
- **State:** IN-PROGRESS — **PR #434 open** (`claude/governance-port-to-repo`).
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** `docs/maps-go-live-governance.md` carries Instructions rows 331–344, 346–362,
  379–394; `CLAUDE.md` gains the division-of-record pointer. Verified current: rows **1–396 are
  byte-identical between workbook 0070 and 0071**, so the port reflects the live revision.
  `docs/**` and `CLAUDE.md` are already in `unit-tests.yml`'s path filters, so `unit` registers.
- **Acceptance:** merged; no future session depends on the workbook upload for the rules.

### 6b. SD-FIX — `Pending Invoice Payment` — **RESOLVED**
- **State:** DONE (pending the confirming monitor run) · **Gate:** cleared by the founder
- **Outcome:** mapped to `proposed`. A parallel session (`915eaab`) landed the same
  `status_to_bucket` change but left `_receipts` untouched; `f5c9e22`/HEAD adds the
  supersession, which was the missing half.
- ⚠️ **My first reading of the receipt was WRONG and the correction matters.** I quoted only
  its closing clause — *"the dataset is APPROVED/issued permits by construction (its own
  title), so no pre-issuance status exists"* — and concluded the entry had never been probed.
  The **first half of the same 1,637-character string** is a genuine 2026-07-16 enumeration:
  28,515 rows, 151 type|status combos, vocabulary verbatim, **5 statuses found**.
- **So the supersession overturns the INFERENCE only.** The enumeration was correct when run;
  the "by construction" line inferred from the dataset title that no pre-issuance status
  *could* exist, and that is the part that is wrong. The vocabulary grew — **expiry, not
  error**, the same shape as the TX government feeds. The receipt explicitly states the
  original enumeration is not being called incorrect.
- **Rule shipped from this** (PR #436): a receipt may hold both a measurement and an inference;
  quote and evaluate the whole receipt before superseding any part, and mark a
  "by construction"/"by definition" clause as inference even inside a real probe.

### 6c. SD-UNREACHABLE — the drift report counts unreachables but never names them
- **State:** **DONE — PR #438 open.** Both failure paths now carry a distinct reason; the report
  emits a named `registry_id · family · field · why` table, and states `Unreachable: 0`
  positively when there are none. `test/unreachable-naming.test.mjs`, 5 assertions, pins the
  naming rather than the counting. Suite 68 → 69. · **Gate:** NONE
- ⚠️ **This is not a logging gap.** For those 3 entries, "unreachable" reads **identically to
  "clean" in every downstream consumer** — the exact failure this check exists to prevent,
  reproduced inside the check. A nightly green is currently compatible with 3 entries never
  having been read at all.
- **Detail:** run `30569691125` reports `unreachable: 3` **once, in the section header, and
  emits no list**. Verified by searching the whole drift section: exactly one occurrence of the
  word. Gating, Tier-2, Tier-3 and `status_unresolved` findings all name their `registry_id`;
  unreachables do not. So for those 3 entries "unreachable" is indistinguishable from "clean" —
  the instrument-silence failure (§8) inside the instrument built to prevent it.
- **New item rather than an extension of #428 (Rule 16)** — found mid-flight on authorized work.
- **Acceptance:** the report names each unreachable `registry_id` and the reason its reader
  returned null.

### 6d. REGISTRY-COLLISION-PROTOCOL — state the concurrency check before any registry edit
- **State:** **DONE** — shipped in PR #436 as "A concurrent writer is a design constraint, not
  an accident". · **Gate:** NONE · **Depends on:** —
- **Why:** **two registry collisions in one day.** A parallel session wired the TX
  `government_notice` feeds (15:48 / 18:20 UTC), and another landed the *same* San Diego
  `status_to_bucket` map in `915eaab` while this session was preparing it. Both were caught —
  the first by a `stale info` push rejection, the second by reading the remote before
  force-pushing — but **converging on the same edit twice is luck, not method.** Two sessions
  with write access to one registry needs a stated protocol.
- **The protocol:** before any `jurisdiction-registry.json` edit, check whether another session
  has touched that entry on `main` (or on the target branch) since your branch point, and
  **say so in the report** — naming the entry, the commits inspected, and the result.
  `git log --since=<branch-point> -S'"registry_id": "<id>"' origin/main` is the cheap form.
- **Never resolve a collision by force-push.** Rebase onto the other session's work and commit
  only the delta it is missing — that is what recovered the San Diego `_receipts` supersession,
  which `915eaab` had left untouched.
- **Acceptance:** the check is stated in every registry-edit report; the rule lands in
  `docs/maps-go-live-governance.md`.

### 7. TDLR-TABS — investigate before fix-or-delete
- **State:** READY
- **Gate:** NONE to investigate. **GATED:** deleting the entry.
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** `scripts/tdlr-tabs.fixture-test.ts` imports a module that does not exist — yet
  TDLR/TABS backs the shipped Travis County dossier (78617, the 5 Caldwell filings). Settled
  (row 341): **investigate before any fix-or-delete.**
- **Acceptance:** report explaining the contradiction, before any change.

### 8. SHELBY-429 — build the opendatasoft connector
- **State:** BLOCKED
- **Gate:** **New connector family = new code. Founder authorization to build.**
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** `shelby-county-building-permits` is dead config — **three independent
  confirmations** that no `sources/opendatasoft.ts` exists and the entry emits 0 records
  cache-wide (row 377). Founder decision stands: **BUILD it, do not drop the entry.**
- **Acceptance:** connector built, entry emits records, fixture suite in CI.

### 9. PGNET-EGRESS — is our probe path producing false negatives?
- **State:** IN-PROGRESS — **priority: above all state work** (founder, 2026-07-30)
- **Gate:** **REPORT ONLY.** No fix, no retry logic, no scheduled job without approval.
- ⛔ **Renamed and widened from PGNET-503** (itself the supersession of PGNET-WATCHDOG, which
  treated a stall that does not exist). Widened because this is now a **CORRECTNESS** problem,
  not a throughput one: **a `candidates_exhausted` verdict from our probe path is currently
  unsafe**, and we have already seen what a wrong exhausted verdict costs — 99 pages nearly
  written off on a guessed 404.
- **Evidence — two distinct signatures:**
  - **503s:** `1,092 OK · 452 HTTP 503 · 30 request timeouts · 5 DNS timeouts`, **queue depth 0**
    — a ~31% failure rate.
  - **400s:** four probes across **three unrelated hosts** — `bexar.org` ×2,
    `newtools.cira.state.tx.us`, `harriscountytx.legistar.com` — all returning **~330-byte 400s**
    (339/339/311/339). That uniformity is an egress signature, not four coincidental refusals.
  - **WebFetch returns 403** on `bexar.org` and `harriscountytx.legistar.com` — a *different*
    status from a *different* datacenter egress path. Two paths, two rejections, neither clean.
- **Three questions, report only:**
  1. **The 503s** — cold starts, concurrency limits, memory, or rate limiting? Does
     `dev_refresh_tick` silently absorb them, how many scheduled refreshes fail per day, and does
     anything retry?
  2. **The 400s** — capture a **full response body and headers**. WAF fingerprinting Supabase
     egress, a missing User-Agent, or something we send? A ~330-byte uniform body across
     unrelated hosts should be identifiable.
  3. ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT — what fraction of TX-GOV's `verification_blocked` verdicts are actually
     ours?** Re-run the blocked probes through a channel that is **not** pg_net. In flight:
     `recon-fetch.yml` on a GitHub runner (clean egress) with `scripts/recon/tx-egress-recheck.json`
     — 8 blocked targets **plus 2 known-200 controls** (Comal, Denton) so a runner-wide failure is
     distinguishable from a per-host one.
- **Why Q3 matters:** if our probe path produces false negatives, **the TX inventory understates
  what is reachable and TX-GOV was parked on bad data.** TX-GOV is **not** being reopened now —
  the question is whether it was parked for the right reason.
- **Acceptance:** all three answered with measurements. No remedy recorded until it is shown to
  *cause* the recovery.

### 10. ARLINGTON-DELTA — measure the clean delta
- **State:** BLOCKED (waiting on the rolling refresh)
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** the pre-deploy baseline was destroyed by a post-deploy refresh, costing the clean
  −397 figure (row 344). **Do NOT re-fire the Arlington ZIPs to force a delta** (row 341) —
  let the rolling refresh carry them.
- **Acceptance:** delta measured on naturally-refreshed rows.

### 11–16. Tier 1 closeout — 629 pages, converts SIX states
Row 356, cheapest first. Principle (row 354): **FINISH BEFORE STARTING** — a state at 74%
converts to COMPLETE far cheaper than a state at 0%, and states-completed is the metric.

| ID | State | Remaining | % done | State | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ST-DE | Delaware | 22 | 68% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-CO | Colorado | 37 | 74% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-OR | Oregon | 89 | 56% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-WA | Washington | 105 | 71% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-AZ | Arizona | 148 | 59% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-CA | California | 228 | 56% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |

- **Depends on:** Tier 0 (TX-GOV, EXP-HARRIS-BEXAR) per row 355 — fixing a live state beats
  widening to a new one.
- **DE is a single session. AZ carries editorial weight** (Phoenix data-centre corridor).
- **Acceptance, each:** Phase 7 report — pages modelled vs total · per-capability coverage ·
  per-county source verdicts · what renders honest-empty and why. A state is **not** live
  until the founder accepts that report.
- ⚠️ **Launching a NEW state is gated — ask first** (row 362). Tier 1 is closeout, not launch.

## Reconciliation log

Numbers reconciled against the artifact before acting (Rule 15).

| Instruction said | Artifact says | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| "main is at 9f0c5d8" | `git log --oneline -1 origin/main` → **`0d011e6`**; `9f0c5d8` is its parent. Row 365 confirms main carries both. | Both true, counted differently: `9f0c5d8` is the last *registry* commit, `0d011e6` is CLAUDE.md-only. Rebasing #428 onto current main (`0d011e6`) is equivalent — #428 does not touch CLAUDE.md. **Assumption stated, not asked.** |
| Tier 1: DE 22 · CO 37 · OR 89 · WA 105 · AZ 148 · CA 228 | Row 356 identical; sums to **629** = row 356's stated total. | ✅ Matches. |
| "1,136 live, 8,215 remain" of 12,722 | 1,136 + 8,215 = 9,351 ≠ 12,722. | **Not an error** — the 3,371 gap is pages already modelled inside the 34 partial states. "Remaining" counts pages left to model, not pages in unfinished states. Both figures right, counting different things. |
| Chat seed listed 6 items | Row 376 lists 5 more still outstanding: San Diego, tdlr-tabs, Shelby, pg_net watchdog, Arlington delta. | Added as items 6–10. QUEUE.md must never drift from reality (row 348); omitting known in-flight work would be drift. |
| "pg_net worker stalls — clear with `net.worker_restart()`" (workbook row 391 + governance doc) | Measured 2026-07-30: **queue depth 0**, `1,092 OK · 452 503 · 30 request timeouts · 5 DNS timeouts` — a **~31% request-failure rate**, not a stall. | **SUPERSEDED.** `worker_restart()` never cleared anything; the requests timed out and the queue drained on its own. I applied it twice today and credited it for a drain it did not cause — post hoc, an inference recorded where a measurement belongs. Item re-scoped to PGNET-503. |
| Chat order: DB-01 → #428 → #431 → TX → Harris/Bexar → Tier 1 | Row 355 puts Tier 0 (TX, Harris/Bexar) ahead of Tier 1. | ✅ **No conflict** — chat order also places both ahead of Tier 1. No dependency inversion found: #431 is independent of #428, and the row-349 inversion (status_unresolved at step 2 depending on #428 at step 4) is dissolved because Group B is already committed. |
| Rows 329 + 364: #428 test-rebase "clean, **67/67**" | Measured on the actual rebases: `main` **62** · #428 adds 2 test files (`status-drift-windowing`, `unmapped-status-sample`) → **64** · #431 adds 4 → **66** · both merged → **68**. | **67 matches none of these.** Most likely taken when #428 carried only one new test file (62+4+1). All four measured numbers are green; no work is blocked. Flagged, not worked around. **Correction:** an earlier version of this row cited row 376 — the claim actually lived in rows 329 and 364. Verify the citation as well as the number. |
| DB-01 hypothesis (row 397) | Disproved on four independent counts. | **SUPERSEDED**, and the founder has already recorded it in workbook 0071 rows 399–401. Not re-reported. |
