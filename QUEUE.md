# QUEUE

In-flight work for the Maps / ingest go-live run. **Claude Code owns this file** — updated in
the same PR as the work, or as a standalone commit when nothing else changes. It must never
drift from reality.

Format per workbook `0070Maps IngestFeedInventory.xlsx` Instructions row 348. Seeded from
row 376 (the corrected queue) — **not** row 364, which is superseded.

**Division of record (row 396):** QUEUE.md holds in-flight work — items, states, gates,
dependencies. The workbook holds settled outcomes, rules, worked examples, and measured
per-ZIP/per-source state. Do not mirror queue items into the workbook; two queues drift.

## Rules of use (row 349)

- **Re-read this file before starting anything.**
- **If a founder instruction conflicts with it, SAY SO AND ASK** — never silently follow the
  newer one. When handed a sequence, reconcile it against this file and report any conflict
  **before** acting.
- Dependencies are explicit. An item can never be ordered before something it modifies.
- **Rule 16:** scope is fixed at authorization. New findings become new items here, not
  extensions of work in progress — this binds the founder as much as the agent.

## Standing frame

- **Goal (row 380):** 12,722 ZIP pages, 50 states. Live: NV 158 + TX 668 + UT 310 = **1,136**.
  **8,215 remain** — 5,647 across 34 partial states, 2,568 across 13 untouched.
- **LIVE is not COVERED (row 381).** Texas is the standing example. ⚠️ **The "zero
  `government_notice` sources" half is FALSE as measured 2026-07-30** — see TX-GOV below.
  The principle stands; the number does not. Always report both numbers.
- **7-phase playbook (rows 383–389).** Phases 1–6 are the work and are autonomous.
  **Phase 7 is the gate: the CLAIM** — sitemap, coverage claim, or reporting a state live.
  One report per state at Phase 7, not per phase.
- **Check the known blockers (row 391) before debugging any environment problem.**

## Ordered items

### 1. DB-01 — `public.communities` planner-statistics diagnosis
- **State:** **DONE** (2026-07-30) — recorded in workbook 0071 rows 399–401; row 397 marked
  SUPERSEDED.
- **Gate:** was NONE for investigation. No autovacuum or schema change was made.
- **Depends on:** —
- **SUPERSEDED: the hypothesis was FALSE on every count.** It claimed no planner statistics, so
  the planner assumed the table was empty and chose sequential scans over the GIN index.
  1. **The planner was never blind.** `pg_class.reltuples` = **13,212** (real 13,292, 0.6% off)
     and `pg_stats` carried all **10** columns including `zip_codes`. `n_live_tup` belongs to the
     cumulative stats collector — a different subsystem from the planner.
  2. **`n_live_tup = 0` was arithmetically correct.** `communities` has had **zero writes** in
     the stats window (`n_tup_ins/upd/del` all 0), so the derived live-tuple figure is 0 and
     `n_mod_since_analyze = 0`, which is why autovacuum correctly never fired — there was
     nothing to analyze. Positive controls on the same query: `alerts` 374 ins → 11,526 live;
     `app_projects` 930,086 ins → 2,641,302 live.
  3. **The GIN index was already serving the hot path** — `idx_scan` = **14,697**, and the live
     plan is `Bitmap Index Scan on idx_communities_zip_codes_gin`, 0.465 ms.
  4. **ANALYZE changed no plan.** `reltuples` 13,212 → 13,292, `n_live_tup` 0 → 13,292, plan
     identical, 0.465 → 0.453 ms (noise).
  5. **Scope error caught:** `pg_stat_statements` had been reset ~2.5 h earlier while the table
     counters cover a far longer window, so the 5,977 seq scans **cannot** be attributed from
     it. Stated rather than guessed.
- **Settled, unchanged:** regional read replicas are NOT the lever.
- **Spun out:** see DB-02 below.

### 1a. DB-02 — latent: `communities` slug lookup cannot use its index
- **State:** BLOCKED (no action needed today — recorded so it is not rediscovered as an
  emergency; workbook 0071 row 400)
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** the only slug index is `communities_slug_lower_key` on the **expression**
  `lower(slug)`, which a plain `slug = $1` predicate cannot use — hence `idx_scan = 0` on it and
  a 13,291-row `Seq Scan` (3.209 ms) when that predicate is issued. **Harmless today: no code
  path issues it** — `hs-resolve.js` uses `zip_codes=cs.{…}` (GIN) and `id=in.(…)` (PK).
- **Acceptance:** if anything ever queries by raw slug, either add a plain btree on `slug` or
  make the query use `lower(slug)`.

### 2. PR-428 — registry status/type maps + drift gate
- **State:** IN-PROGRESS — **rebased onto `0d011e6`** (current main; founder confirmed the
  prompt's two shas were contradictory). 4 commits preserved, suite **64/64 green**. San Diego
  dispatch running.
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** —
- **Actual state (rows 370–375, verified from GitHub):** open, `mergeable_state: clean`,
  head `claude/loving-archimedes-gtqk76` @ `e0afcc6`, **4 commits**, 9 files, +907/−25,
  based on `c49c7c4`.
- ⚠️ **Group A and Group B are ALREADY COMMITTED. Do not re-scope them.** Group A:
  new-orleans +27 · new-hanover +6 · tacoma-accela +1 · gilbert-energov +1. Group B:
  `status_unresolved` for cincinnati 7 · new-orleans 2 · fort-collins 1 · san-jose 1.
- **Remaining, exactly three things:** (1) rebase onto `0d011e6` — **done**, 64/64 (not the
  recorded 67/67; see the reconciliation log);
  (2) **San Diego `workflow_dispatch`** — the last unaudited entry; (3) merge when the drift
  check would run green.
- **Acceptance:** rebased · San Diego observed · drift check green · merged. **No 105/105
  claim until San Diego is observed** (row 344 — do not round a partial up to a complete).

### 3. PR-431 — connector fixture suites into CI
- **State:** IN-PROGRESS — **rebased onto `0d011e6`**, suite **66/66 green**, CI running.
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** — (independent of #428; both branched from `c49c7c4`)
- **Detail:** head `claude/fixture-suites-into-ci` @ `44df2e0`, 1 commit, 8 files, +60/−31.
  Moves 4 never-referenced `scripts/*.fixture-test.ts` suites under `test/` so the runner
  discovers them. Row 342: these produced **no signal**, never a false green. Row 351: it is
  **four** renames, not five — `tdlr-tabs` imports a nonexistent module and cannot be moved.
- **Acceptance:** merged, `unit` green at 66 files.

### 4. TX-GOV — Texas `government_notice`
- **State:** READY (Tier 0 — close out live states first, row 355)
- **Gate:** NONE for scoping and reporting. Phase 7 GATED as for any state.
- **Depends on:** —
- ⚠️ **SCOPE CONTRADICTED BY MEASUREMENT — awaiting founder ruling.** Rows 328/355/364/381
  say "zero sources wired." Measured live 2026-07-30: **4 active `government_notice` feeds
  writing to `alerts` across 3 of 22 counties, producing 132 notices, newest 18:06Z** —
  Denton 102 (Granicus RSS + RSS), Brazoria 25 (Legistar), Williamson 5 (RSS). A 5th row,
  `travis-tx-civicclerk-meetings`, is `pipeline_type='government_notice'` but
  `target_table='meetings'`, which is why the count reads 5 by pipeline_type and 4 by
  target_table. National control: 747 active gov feeds / 16 states / 1,259 notices.
- **Both numbers:** TX is **668/668 pages live**; **58/668 (8.7%) carry notices**; 610 render
  honest-empty; **19 of 22 counties have no notice source**, incl. Dallas 174 pages, El Paso
  145, Tarrant 99, Travis 86.
- **Detail:** this is a PARTIAL build on already-supported connectors, not an unstarted one.
- **Acceptance:** per-county source verdict for all 22 using the three-state system
  (`first_party_found` · `verification_blocked` · `candidates_exhausted`; **never assign
  `aggregator_locked` autonomously**), what is wireable on an already-supported connector
  family vs what needs new code, and what renders honest-empty and why.

### 5. EXP-HARRIS-BEXAR — Step B expansion
- **State:** BLOCKED
- **Gate:** **Founder decision — it moves the coverage claim.** Report, then hold.
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** Harris has 1 modeled ZIP, Bexar 2, leaving **4 correctly-wired entries emitting
  0 records**. Precedent: NYC-borough / Boston-Suffolk / Philadelphia-County.
- **Acceptance:** pages-added and per-entry record counts reported as page-level deltas
  (Rule 10). **Then stop** — no rows inserted, no coverage claim changed.

### 6. SD-AUDIT — San Diego `workflow_dispatch`
- **State:** IN-PROGRESS — `source-monitor.yml` dispatched on the #428 ref with
  `dry_run=true` (observes, commits nothing). No per-entry input exists; the drift check sweeps
  all 105, so San Diego is audited as part of the sweep.
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** PR-428 (the drift check it exercises lives on that branch)
- **Detail:** the last unaudited entry of the 105. It is the CSV-family reader
  (`san-diego-approved-permits`, a 15 MB published file), which is why it was never observed.
- **Acceptance:** run observed; only then may the entry set be described as complete.
  **No 105/105 claim until then.**

### 6a. GOV-PORT — port durable governance out of the workbook onto main
- **State:** IN-PROGRESS — **PR #434 open** (`claude/governance-port-to-repo`).
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** `docs/maps-go-live-governance.md` carries Instructions rows 331–344, 346–362,
  379–394; `CLAUDE.md` gains the division-of-record pointer. Verified current: rows **1–396 are
  byte-identical between workbook 0070 and 0071**, so the port reflects the live revision.
  `docs/**` and `CLAUDE.md` are already in `unit-tests.yml`'s path filters, so `unit` registers.
- **Acceptance:** merged; no future session depends on the workbook upload for the rules.

### 7. TDLR-TABS — investigate before fix-or-delete
- **State:** READY
- **Gate:** NONE to investigate. **GATED:** deleting the entry.
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** `scripts/tdlr-tabs.fixture-test.ts` imports a module that does not exist — yet
  TDLR/TABS backs the shipped Travis County dossier (78617, the 5 Caldwell filings). Settled
  (row 341): **investigate before any fix-or-delete.**
- **Acceptance:** report explaining the contradiction, before any change.

### 8. SHELBY-429 — build the opendatasoft connector
- **State:** BLOCKED
- **Gate:** **New connector family = new code. Founder authorization to build.**
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** `shelby-county-building-permits` is dead config — **three independent
  confirmations** that no `sources/opendatasoft.ts` exists and the entry emits 0 records
  cache-wide (row 377). Founder decision stands: **BUILD it, do not drop the entry.**
- **Acceptance:** connector built, entry emits records, fixture suite in CI.

### 9. PGNET-WATCHDOG — stalled-worker watchdog
- **State:** READY (**hygiene priority, not urgent** — row 327/341)
- **Gate:** NONE to build. **Note row 391:** state billing impact before adding any scheduled
  job; prefer extending `source-monitor`'s existing `0 7 * * *` run over a new one.
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** worker stalled twice in one session (263 queued, 15 min no completions);
  `net.worker_restart()` cleared it both times. `dev_refresh_tick` drives the rolling ZIP
  refresh through pg_net, so a stall halts refresh with no signal. **History disproves silent
  data rot:** 12,722 cached ZIPs, oldest `refreshed_at` 2026-07-25, only 10 rows staler than
  2 days, **0 staler than 7**.
- **Acceptance:** a stall raises a signal; no new scheduled job.

### 10. ARLINGTON-DELTA — measure the clean delta
- **State:** BLOCKED (waiting on the rolling refresh)
- **Gate:** NONE
- **Depends on:** —
- **Detail:** the pre-deploy baseline was destroyed by a post-deploy refresh, costing the clean
  −397 figure (row 344). **Do NOT re-fire the Arlington ZIPs to force a delta** (row 341) —
  let the rolling refresh carry them.
- **Acceptance:** delta measured on naturally-refreshed rows.

### 11–16. Tier 1 closeout — 629 pages, converts SIX states
Row 356, cheapest first. Principle (row 354): **FINISH BEFORE STARTING** — a state at 74%
converts to COMPLETE far cheaper than a state at 0%, and states-completed is the metric.

| ID | State | Remaining | % done | State | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ST-DE | Delaware | 22 | 68% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-CO | Colorado | 37 | 74% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-OR | Oregon | 89 | 56% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-WA | Washington | 105 | 71% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-AZ | Arizona | 148 | 59% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |
| ST-CA | California | 228 | 56% | READY | Ph 1–6 NONE · **Ph 7 founder gate** |

- **Depends on:** Tier 0 (TX-GOV, EXP-HARRIS-BEXAR) per row 355 — fixing a live state beats
  widening to a new one.
- **DE is a single session. AZ carries editorial weight** (Phoenix data-centre corridor).
- **Acceptance, each:** Phase 7 report — pages modelled vs total · per-capability coverage ·
  per-county source verdicts · what renders honest-empty and why. A state is **not** live
  until the founder accepts that report.
- ⚠️ **Launching a NEW state is gated — ask first** (row 362). Tier 1 is closeout, not launch.

## Reconciliation log

Numbers reconciled against the artifact before acting (Rule 15).

| Instruction said | Artifact says | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| "main is at 9f0c5d8" | `git log --oneline -1 origin/main` → **`0d011e6`**; `9f0c5d8` is its parent. Row 365 confirms main carries both. | Both true, counted differently: `9f0c5d8` is the last *registry* commit, `0d011e6` is CLAUDE.md-only. Rebasing #428 onto current main (`0d011e6`) is equivalent — #428 does not touch CLAUDE.md. **Assumption stated, not asked.** |
| Tier 1: DE 22 · CO 37 · OR 89 · WA 105 · AZ 148 · CA 228 | Row 356 identical; sums to **629** = row 356's stated total. | ✅ Matches. |
| "1,136 live, 8,215 remain" of 12,722 | 1,136 + 8,215 = 9,351 ≠ 12,722. | **Not an error** — the 3,371 gap is pages already modelled inside the 34 partial states. "Remaining" counts pages left to model, not pages in unfinished states. Both figures right, counting different things. |
| Chat seed listed 6 items | Row 376 lists 5 more still outstanding: San Diego, tdlr-tabs, Shelby, pg_net watchdog, Arlington delta. | Added as items 6–10. QUEUE.md must never drift from reality (row 348); omitting known in-flight work would be drift. |
| Chat order: DB-01 → #428 → #431 → TX → Harris/Bexar → Tier 1 | Row 355 puts Tier 0 (TX, Harris/Bexar) ahead of Tier 1. | ✅ **No conflict** — chat order also places both ahead of Tier 1. No dependency inversion found: #431 is independent of #428, and the row-349 inversion (status_unresolved at step 2 depending on #428 at step 4) is dissolved because Group B is already committed. |
| Rows 329 + 364: #428 test-rebase "clean, **67/67**" | Measured on the actual rebases: `main` **62** · #428 adds 2 test files (`status-drift-windowing`, `unmapped-status-sample`) → **64** · #431 adds 4 → **66** · both merged → **68**. | **67 matches none of these.** Most likely taken when #428 carried only one new test file (62+4+1). All four measured numbers are green; no work is blocked. Flagged, not worked around. **Correction:** an earlier version of this row cited row 376 — the claim actually lived in rows 329 and 364. Verify the citation as well as the number. |
| DB-01 hypothesis (row 397) | Disproved on four independent counts. | **SUPERSEDED**, and the founder has already recorded it in workbook 0071 rows 399–401. Not re-reported. |
